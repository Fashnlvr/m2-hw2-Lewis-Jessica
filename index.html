  <h1>About Me, Jessica Lewis</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my personal page! I am a Talent Acquisition Specialist focused in the technology industry which has allowed me to gain exposure to the demand for business professionals with advanced technical proficiency. After all, we live in a society that has grown increasingly reliant on technology, making it a pertinent aspect of our personal and professional lives. Here is where you will find facts about me and what inspires me to pursue my goals with fierce ambition.</p>
  <h2>Career Goals</h2>
  <p>While my goal is to continue working in my current field of Talent Acquisition, I would like to expand my career to become a recruitment marketing professional. This career goal is what attracted me to the Master of Arts in Mass Communication with a focus on Online Communication and Web Design. The completion of this graduate program in conjunction with my existing professional background will afford me the skillsets necessary to become a Digital Marketing Manager who advises businesses on implementing engaging recruitment marketing strategies that will allow them to attract the best talent. </p>
    <p>My desire to acquire Web Design skills stems from the occurrences in current and previous positions where there was a need for someone who understood the basics of coding to continue meeting business demands. For instance, in one of my previous roles, I led the implementation of a new applicant tracking system. The purpose of this platform was to allow us to engage with candidates more effectively through a user-friendly website interface. However, we had to seek the help of a web designer to plug in the new features to meet our goal. The offering of strategic communication skills in conjunction with the ability to code would lend itself well to achieving the primary goal in Talent Acquisition, establishing a presence that enables the company to build a dynamic talent pipeline while promoting brand awareness to current and potential clients.</p>

  <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>These are the activities that I most enjoy during my spare time. I've even included a few bonus categories that I would like to begin exploring in the near future.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube has a plethora of videos that help you bring your ideas and passions into reality.</a></p>
  <h3>Current</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Start a blog. This is something that will start as a hobby but turn into a career pursuit once I get the hang of it.</li> 
    <li>Resell clothing on Poshmark and eBay. I first started buying clothing items and accessories to resale on Poshmark following the completion of my Associate's Degree. I knew I wanted to continue pursuing a higher education but needed some extra money to take care of my some expenses. I found the reselling process to be very exciting as I love searching for the best deals to sell the item to someone who will make better use of it than me. What makes this hobby even better is the fact that I can earn pretty good money doing it.</li>
